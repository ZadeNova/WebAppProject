# WebAppProject
<h2 align="center">What is this project about?</h2>
It is a project for my year 2 semester 2 course. Basically web development but using C# and asp.net.
Goal of the project was to develop the website to fit the project requirements by a deadline.
The project would then be assessed based on the criterias that the course teachers have shown us.
